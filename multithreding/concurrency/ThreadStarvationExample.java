/*
 * **Thread starvation** happens when a thread keeps waiting because other threads are always using the resources it needs. 
 * This makes the thread "starve," as it canâ€™t finish its task because it never gets a turn.
 * 
 * Example Scenario in Java
   Suppose there are three threads:

Thread A and Thread B are high-priority threads that keep running.
Thread C is a low-priority thread that rarely gets a chance to run.
